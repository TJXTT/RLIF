'''
`max_threads_number_for_datasets_preprocess` defines the maximum threads for datasets preprocessing, which is 
1. reading binary events and saving them to numpy format
2. integrating events to frames.

Note that a too larger `max_threads_number_for_datasets_preprocess` will overload the disc and slow down the speed.
'''

cuda_threads = 1024
'''
`cuda_threads` defines the default threads number for CUDA kernel.

It is recommended that `cuda_threads` is the power of 2.
'''

cuda_compiler_options = ('-use_fast_math',)
'''
`cuda_compiler_options` defines the compiler options passed to the backend (NVRTC or NVCC).
